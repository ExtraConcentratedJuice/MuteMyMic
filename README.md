# MuteMyMic
An application for muting your microphone until a set combination of keys is held (push-to-talk).

# Installation
You must have the [.NET Core 3.1 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) installed on your PC to use this application.

Download a build from the [releases](https://github.com/ExtraConcentratedJuice/MuteMyMic/releases). Unzip it into a directory of your choice. Desktop/MuteMyMic or Program Files/MuteMyMic are good choices.

Start the application through MuteMyMic.exe.

# Usage
You may set a key combination for unmute by clicking on Settings -> Set Hotkey.

You may set a delay for unmute by clickong on Settings -> Set Unmute Delay. This feature is useful for making sure that you do not cut out too early on unmute.

You may play a sound on unmute and mute by clicking on Settings -> Play Sounds On Mute Toggle.

You may set the application to run at startup by clicking on Settings -> Run On Startup.

The application can be hidden through clicking on "Hide" in the menu bar. MuteMyMic will be minimized to the app tray if this is done. It can be pulled from the tray by double clicking on its icon.

To close MuteMyMic, click File -> Exit on the menu bar or right click the tray icon and click "Exit".

To change the mute and unmute sounds, you may replace mute.wav and unmute.wav in the application directory with your WAV soundfiles of choice.
